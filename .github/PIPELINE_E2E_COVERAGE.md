# Pipeline E2E Coverage

What the **Pipeline SLURM E2E** (`.github/workflows/pipeline-slurm-e2e.yml`, self-hosted runner on the private `hzi-bifo/SeqDesk-ci` mirror) actually exercises. The workflow boots a real SeqDesk app against an ephemeral Postgres, seeds dummy data, and drives pipelines through the app's HTTP API in **local** and **SLURM** execution modes, then asserts the database writeback.

> Keep this in sync when adding a pipeline or an assertion. It's the quick answer to "is X tested, and how?"

Legend: ✅ asserted · ⬜ known gap (fillable now, no blocker) · — not covered yet.

**Known gaps to fill (no external blocker):**

- **fastqc / reads-qc** — first pipelines whose processes declare a `bioconda::` conda directive, so Nextflow builds a **per-process conda env at runtime** (~60–90s). The env build itself works (runner has bioconda network). Two real blockers found and fixed/deferred:
  - **Fixed (app bug #5):** the slow run exposed a **completed→running resurrection** — `syncPipelineRunForOperator`'s with-trace branch had no terminal guard, so a re-sync could un-complete a finished run. Fixed in `pipeline-run-ops-service.ts` (`runWasTerminal` guard) + regression test.
  - **Open (test isolation):** fastqc runs **last** on the *shared* dummy order, but by then simulate-reads (replace mode) has repointed that order's reads at `simulated/…`, and the **failure-path test moved those FASTQs aside without fully restoring them** — so fastqc fails with "FASTQ file not found". Fix needs real isolation: give the destructive failure-path test (and/or fastqc) its **own order**, or make the sabotage restore bulletproof, so one pipeline's mutations don't bleed into the next.
  - Also: per-process conda env files in the run dir break the **artifact upload** step (symlinks/size) — exclude the `work/conda/` dir from the upload before re-enabling.
  - Reminder: place risky pipeline steps **after** the proven ones (already done) so a failure can't skip established coverage.

### What every covered run asserts

- The pipeline **runs to completion** on the compute node (SLURM) / runner (local) and produces its output files.
- DB run state: `status='completed'`, `completedAt` set, `progress=100` (re-fetched after a sync + settle to ride out the dual-writer race).
- DB **writeback** appropriate to the pipeline (see table) — i.e. results are *ingested into the database*, not just written to disk.
- SLURM runs additionally: `#SBATCH` directives present, a numeric `sacct` job id, and the node-local SLURM capture logs copied back (NFS-lag tolerant).

### Failure-path coverage

`run-slurm-failure-e2e.mjs` deliberately fails a **fastq-checksum** SLURM run (moves the sample FASTQ aside) and asserts the DB reconciles to `status='failed'` with `completedAt` + a `Failed` marker — the status-reconciliation path that previously got stuck at 99%.

## Execution / topology notes (CI-specific)

- The runner and SLURM compute nodes share **only a dedicated cluster filesystem**; `/home` is per-node. The run dir, input data, conda env, and pipeline packages all live on the shared filesystem (configured via the `SLURM_SHARED_*` Actions variables on the private mirror). The conda env is referenced by **full prefix path** (names don't resolve across nodes here).
- QOS caps the user to **1 submitted job**, so pipelines run as a **single SLURM job** with Nextflow's local executor inside (`SEQDESK_SLURM_INLINE_EXECUTOR=1`) rather than one job per process. Real multi-node parallelism (e.g. MAG at scale) needs the admin to raise the QOS limit.
- There is **no weblog block** in the generated `nextflow.config` (compute nodes can't reach the app's loopback), so output resolution runs via the **`/sync` API** and the **pipeline-monitor**, not weblog callbacks. (Confirmed at runtime: `statusSource=queue`.)

## Real bugs this E2E has caught

The suite exists to find app issues, not just to be green. So far it surfaced and fixed:

1. **Config loader dropped `SEQDESK_CONDA_ENV`** — a configured conda env name was silently ignored (default-config `trackSources` gap).
2. **Pipeline packages dir was not relocatable** — Nextflow ran against a path the compute node couldn't see.
3. **`simpleGlob` ignored literal (wildcard-free) discovery patterns** — script-less pipelines ingested **zero artifacts**.
4. **The pipeline-monitor never resolved outputs** — runs finalized by the safety-net daemon (vs the `/sync` API) were marked completed but had **no artifacts/writebacks** persisted.
5. **A terminal run could be resurrected on trace re-sync** — `syncPipelineRunForOperator`'s with-trace branch had no terminal guard, so a re-sync that saw a stale trace task still reading RUNNING (or a momentarily-active queue) flipped a `completed` run back to `running` and nulled its `completedAt`. Same class as the original stuck-at-99% bug.

## Adding a pipeline to the matrix

1. If study-scoped, add it to `STUDY_SCOPED_PIPELINES` in `scripts/run-pipeline-runtime-e2e.mjs`.
2. Add a `WRITEBACK_SPEC` entry: `checksum` (md5 merged onto reads), `replace` (new active read attributed to the run), or `artifacts` (PipelineArtifact rows by outputId) — or extend for read-field writebacks.
3. If its read-field writebacks aren't exposed by the run-GET select (`pipeline-run-ops-service.ts`), extend that select.
4. Add a workflow step: `npm run pipeline:e2e:runtime -- --ensure-dummy-data --pipeline-id <id>` (runs local + SLURM).
5. If the pipeline needs an external DB, stage it on the shared cluster filesystem and point the install profile / env at it; only then flip its row to covered.
