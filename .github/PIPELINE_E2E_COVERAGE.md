# Pipeline E2E Coverage

What the **Pipeline SLURM E2E** (`.github/workflows/pipeline-slurm-e2e.yml`, self-hosted runner on the private `hzi-bifo/SeqDesk-ci` mirror) actually exercises. The workflow boots a real SeqDesk app against an ephemeral Postgres, seeds dummy data, and drives pipelines through the app's HTTP API in **local** and **SLURM** execution modes, then asserts the database writeback.

> Keep this in sync when adding a pipeline or an assertion. It's the quick answer to "is X tested, and how?"

Legend: ✅ asserted · ⬜ known gap (fillable now, no blocker) · — not covered yet.

**Known gaps to fill (no external blocker):**

- **simulate-reads local** — only the SLURM-only smoke runs it (SLURM). Filling it means adding a `replace` kind to `WRITEBACK_SPEC` and a runtime step `--pipeline-id simulate-reads` (runs local + SLURM).

### What every covered run asserts

- The pipeline **runs to completion** on the compute node (SLURM) / runner (local) and produces its output files.
- DB run state: `status='completed'`, `completedAt` set, `progress=100` (re-fetched after a sync + settle to ride out the dual-writer race).
- DB **writeback** appropriate to the pipeline (see table) — i.e. results are *ingested into the database*, not just written to disk.
- SLURM runs additionally: `#SBATCH` directives present, a numeric `sacct` job id, and the node-local SLURM capture logs copied back (NFS-lag tolerant).

### Failure-path coverage

`run-slurm-failure-e2e.mjs` deliberately fails a **fastq-checksum** SLURM run (moves the sample FASTQ aside) and asserts the DB reconciles to `status='failed'` with `completedAt` + a `Failed` marker — the status-reconciliation path that previously got stuck at 99%.

## Execution / topology notes (CI-specific)

- The runner and SLURM compute nodes share **only a dedicated cluster filesystem**; `/home` is per-node. The run dir, input data, conda env, and pipeline packages all live on the shared filesystem (configured via the `SLURM_SHARED_*` Actions variables on the private mirror). The conda env is referenced by **full prefix path** (names don't resolve across nodes here).
- QOS caps the user to **1 submitted job**, so pipelines run as a **single SLURM job** with Nextflow's local executor inside (`SEQDESK_SLURM_INLINE_EXECUTOR=1`) rather than one job per process. Real multi-node parallelism (e.g. MAG at scale) needs the admin to raise the QOS limit.
- There is **no weblog block** in the generated `nextflow.config` (compute nodes can't reach the app's loopback), so output resolution runs via the **`/sync` API** and the **pipeline-monitor**, not weblog callbacks. (Confirmed at runtime: `statusSource=queue`.)

## Real bugs this E2E has caught

The suite exists to find app issues, not just to be green. So far it surfaced and fixed:

1. **Config loader dropped `SEQDESK_CONDA_ENV`** — a configured conda env name was silently ignored (default-config `trackSources` gap).
2. **Pipeline packages dir was not relocatable** — Nextflow ran against a path the compute node couldn't see.
3. `**simpleGlob` ignored literal (wildcard-free) discovery patterns** — script-less pipelines ingested **zero artifacts**.
4. **The pipeline-monitor never resolved outputs** — runs finalized by the safety-net daemon (vs the `/sync` API) were marked completed but had **no artifacts/writebacks** persisted.

## Adding a pipeline to the matrix

1. If study-scoped, add it to `STUDY_SCOPED_PIPELINES` in `scripts/run-pipeline-runtime-e2e.mjs`.
2. Add a `WRITEBACK_SPEC` entry (`checksum` / `artifacts` / extend for read-field writebacks).
3. If its read-field writebacks aren't exposed by the run-GET select (`pipeline-run-ops-service.ts`), extend that select.
4. Add a workflow step: `npm run pipeline:e2e:runtime -- --ensure-dummy-data --pipeline-id <id>` (runs local + SLURM).
5. If the pipeline needs an external DB, stage it on the shared cluster filesystem and point the install profile / env at it; only then flip its row to covered.
